# Career Exploration Program - Software Engineer

Welcome to the application for the CEP Software Engineer track! In this app, you'll create a simple "About Me" app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To complete the application and submit it, follow the instructions below.

_The commands and keyboard shortcuts are for Mac users. They may not be accurate for Windows users._

### Creating your Github account

To get started, go to [Github.com](www.github.com) and sign up for an account. If you're unfamiliar with Github, it may be worthwhile to checkout this short [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) to familiarize yourself with some of the terminology.

This is where you will store your finished application. When you're doing with the project, you will submit the link to your repo.

### Downloading an editor

You'll need a code editor in order to complete the project. There are many out there - IntelliJ, Sublime, Atom, etc. If you have a preference, feel free to use it. If not, [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a good choice. Choose your favorite and download it.

### Cloning the repo

You will need to clone this [repo](INSERT LINK HERE).

1. Open up your terminal. You can do this with command + space bar and then type in 'terminal'.
2. You can find out the location of your current working directory by typing in `pwd`.
3. Let's create a new directory to store your coding projects in. Type in `mkdir Projects`.
4. Type in `ls` and you will see that a new directory called 'Projects' was created.
5. Switch into that directory by typing in `cd Projects`.
6. If you type in `ls` again, you'll notice that the folder is empty.
7. Let's add our first repo to the Projects directory. Type in `git clone INSERT LINK`.
8. Once it's downloaded, if you type in `ls` again, you'll notice that your project was added to the directory.
9. Navigate into that project by typing `cd cep-engr-app`.
10. Open up the project with your editor.

## Instructions

 All of your files are in the `src` directory. You'll see that you have one file for HTML, one for CSS, and one for JavaScript.

 Feel free to

 - Include an `h1` with your name
 - Include a short paragraph or 2 explaining why you want to join the program
 - Include an image. It can be anything -- a headshot, a picture of your favorite memory, a picture of your last trip, etc.

### Resources
// TODO put all of the codecademy links and stuff.
